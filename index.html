                <p>
                    I first saw Antara in the Fall of 2008 when we started our undergrad. I was instantly attracted to
                    her but was far too nervous to speak to her. I had told my friend I liked her and news had traveled
                    fast and she soon found out. Her first reaction was "Who is Ram?" and she began searching for me in
                    the class. She started to take notice of me and no matter how boring the lecture was, we never
                    missed a class after that. After a good few months I finally plucked up the courage to ask her out
                    and the rest is history :)

                    <p>It's one of the oldest traditional Indian pre wedding ceremony where the bride and groom
                        attend the event together and a professional mehndi artist applies
                        mehndi to the bride's hands and feet. This will be having a celebratory

                        knot". With booze flowing down the floor and the western attire on, everyone would be busy
                        showing off their new moves on the stage which they have finely honed. Lastly, expect some beer
                        pong matches & karaoke for sure.</p>

                    <p>The haldi ceremony is usually held separately for the bride and the groom. This one is for the
                        bride. It is a low-key event that involves the application of turmeric paste on the hands, legs
                        and face of the bride. The groom is not allowed to see the bride after this ritual until the
                        final wedding ceremony starts.</p>

                        knot. The groom comes with the barat and is greeted by the bride side with some dhol of course
                        as maximum number of guests would be attending this event. This is when the couple circle the
                        sacred fire and are finally declared husband and wife.</p>

                        <p>
                            (in Jess's words) Our love story begins in May 2017, just a suburban girl and boy living in
                            a lonely world. We wound up at the same night of Karaoke at ye old Clydes Willow Creek Farm
                            in Ashburn, one of us because of her need to sing and the other on happenstance and meeting
                            a new group of happy hour friends.
                            I'd like to say that I was the singer in a smoky room, with the smell of wine and cheap
                            perfume when our eyes met but it was not that glamorous (or smoky). It was fate (and a
                            mutual friend) that brought us together for some people watching and singing of our own.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We engaged in small talk about random cover songs we like better than the original and then
                            Danza Kuduro came on. I guess you could say the spirit moved us because it became the first
                            song we ever danced to and definitely not the last. It's my claim that I then stole the song
                            he wanted to sing, "Flagpole Sitta," but according to Geoff he was planning to sing Blink
                            182 all along (he did not call my mom from a payphone that night)...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rest is history as they say, a night that was the making of a beautiful friendship and
                            little did we know then it would turn into much more! I don't always quote Geoff but, as he
                            would say, "we were born ready" for this next adventure together!
                        </p>
